Developing Interactive System. A brief overview of the project.

E-tegu app is an application that allows citizens to take part in local participatory budget projects by voting for them or creating new ones. The application allows users to register and login using ID card. Authentification with Mobile-ID or smart ID will provide a high level of security. The application allows to browse current projects, based on personal interests and location, that can be set up in properties. Additonally there is an option to create your own project, providing name, short description and long description along with keywords and location data. There is also admin environment for moderating and maintaining the platform.
